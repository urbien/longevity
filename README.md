# We can cure aging, thanks to COVID

## Executive Summary 
COVID virus exhibits a specific protein on its surface, a so called "spike" protein.
Vaccine developers created instructions for the body to produce this "spike" protein. 
Immune system destroys the "spikey" and clears COVID virus along the way. Bingo!

We know that similar instructions mechanism is used by placenta cells to direct growth of all tissues in the baby's body. 
We also have anecdotal evidence that these instructions can serve as a fountain of youth for adults. 

To cure decseases of aging all that remains to figure out it what instructions (RNA segments) are essential in the coctail excreeted by placenta cells. Thanks to COVID, we now have the production capacity to produce RNA segments to vaccinate all earthlings from aging.

The right IT platform can accelerate this process by 5 years.

## Background on RNA-based vaccines

## COVID vaccines tell cells to produce certain protein
We are all made of proteins. 
It is a common knowledge that DNA is the source of programming for our body, specifically the instructions to produce proteins. In principle the body manifacturing process consists of just 2 steps:

- A copy of the section of the DNA is made (in the nucleaus of the cell).
- This copy, called RNA, is used to produce proteins (by the ribosomes).

It is unteresting that the cell is dumb and does not know where the RNA has came from. It can come from its own nucleus, from the virus, or from the RNA-based vaccine. Cell sees the RNA and starts producing proteins, dummy :-)

This is how viruses make us sick. They use our own mechanism to trick the cell to produce the proteins that we do not need. Virus is just a bubble with the RNA and it is so small that it can sneak into the cell without a problem. Note that many other things can't pass through the cell membrane, and it is a problem of the drug delivery mechanism, which gives Pharma so much headache. Not an issue with RNA. No issue with body rejecting the RNA either. It is like taking over the line from the ground control.

>RNA is easily destroyed (by enzymes) before it gets into the right place in the cell. So vaccine developers put RNA in the bubble to protect it until it gets to the right place in the cell, to the cell factories that produce proteins based on RNA instructions (ribosomes). 

What is interesting is that our cells themselves produce these RNA bubbles and send them out to other cells. These bubbles are called Exosomes and they are excreeted by most of the cells in our body. This way, like in a well organized manufacturer, all production units work together towards one goal, constantly coordinating their activities.

This is it. COVID-19 vaccines use the same mechnism. 

Ability to produce instructions, packaged in delivery bubbles (Exosomes) artificially and at scale, newfound with COVID-19 vaccines, is a huge deal. This is the way we will save ourselves from becoming idiots and invalids at the end of our lives. COVID-19 just sped up the time to market for Exosomes by a decade, perhaps quarter of a century. 

I know of 2 labs that already breed Exosomes. They take the Exosomes from the specific placenta cells (MSC) that direct other cells in the early stages of life. These Exosomes can be bread and injected into the bloodstream to act as the fountain of youth for our organs. Well, now with COVID vaccines advances, we do not need these placenta cells, we can produce Exosomes 100% artificially. No ethical issues, no human tissues. Easier FDA approval.

What we do not yet know is what specific Exosomes to produce. We need to study the Exosomes excreeted by MSC and study effects of each.

But once we do, this is the end of disease of aging and perhaps of aging itself.

## What remains to do and how IT can help?
Information technology is essential to here to help speed up the research, the clinical trials and the FDA approval management process, perhaps by 3-5 years. 

1. This is a highly regulated field. To speed up the process we need to digitize and enforces compliance protocols. 
1. There is an enormous amount of data that needs Data Governance. 
1. Healthcare has challenging data privacy laws.
1. AI is critical accelerator but sourcing data remains a huge challenge, due to privacy issues. If there was a way for AI to process health data, without asking people to give their data away - this could be the key enabler for research,  trials and clinical monitoring applications.
1. Clinical trials are expensive (3 stages cost upwards of $50M). Trial often fails and all starts anew. IT creates automation, which decreases costs.
1. Trials require identification, screening and monitoring of candidates.
1. Trials require identification, screening and monitoring of participating organizations and processes.
1. Trials require auditable transactional structured messaging with participants, both subjects and staff.
1. Trials require workflow for participants and staff.

## Breakthroughs
Measure true bio age - this is fundamental for a scientific method to work. Until now we could not measure the effectiveness of diet, fasting, supplements, exercise, hot-cold showers, lower doses of stress, and of course the clinical.

1. [Replace 50% of blood plasma with saline solution](https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text). This procedure is already approved by FDA for rare immune deceases. 

1. [Inject young plasma factors](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.082917v1). This has been the subject of much hype, but perhaps we finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.

1. [Thymus (immunity) regeneration](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028). The early clinical study that lasted 1 year has turned the age of 9 aged man back 2.5 years (1.5 year gain). Interestingly the rate of recovery from aging accelerated 3 times in the last 3 months).

1. [Hypothalamus stem cell exosomes, a master control of aging?](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23282). These stem cells singal other cells to keep going, but they deplete with age.

1. [Rejuvenation with placenta stem cell exosomes](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sci/2017/6305295/). Special cells (MSC) produce singals for featus tissues to form, grow and repair, if injured (fetus exibits magic pawers of some salamandras that regrow organs on injuries)

1. [Epigenetic reprogramming](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2975-4). This is the ultimate solution, perhaps. Rsearchers found a way to tell the cells of the [blind mice to regrow](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/710210v1). The experiment was with blindness because FDA already approved the same virus-based delivery method for its cure. But the mechanism is generic - it can turn any cell young again.

## SENS research brought us 25 years forward in anti-aging
[SENS](https://www.sens.org/ ) launched this field, initially with the help of $1M a year pledge from Peter Thiel. Now even [crypto wealth is going into it](https://qz.com/1212040/crypto-millionaires-like-vitalik-buterin-are-funding-research-to-reverse-aging-especially-the-sens-research-foundation/.
