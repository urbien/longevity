## Executive Summary 

We offer to a health field a platform consisting of two parts a CloudPal and a Transactional Messenger. 

- CloudPal holds person's data 100% under their control. Unlike iCloud, Dropbox, etc. person's data is not kept in a common pool with other people, and service provider has no access to data (note that Apple can decrypt yor iCloud data and so can Dropbox, Google Drive, and most other service providers). 
- CloudPal allows AI to process data in-place, instead of asking a person to send it to some central location, which is typical now with any app. This means you don't need to share your data and lose control over them. Data breaches are now everywhere. Even if the service provider is digligent, and does not abuse their access to your data, they will be eventually hacked. Best sharing is not sharing at all.
- Messenger allows to create apps with a universal front-end. This means must faster take up for any new ideas.

## Why our approach to 100% private data so essential?

Innovation in AI and health is astounding, but could be evolving 10x faster still if a broader group of AI developers had access to data. 
If people were the only true owners of their data, they would entrust a lot more data to be kept and processed by federated AI. 

## Why our transactional messaging app so essential? 
Today most of the population is used to WhatsApp or other messenger on mobiles. 
Convenience and wide coverage are there, but for a regulated field this is not enough. Ability to enforce protocols and compliance rules, create auditable records, guaranteed long term storage of data, ability to share structured data, and full Data Governance to assure that AI can make decisions reliably, - all of the above and more are needed in healthcare.

## Collaboration
Tradle is looking to partner with longevity / anti-aging organizations. 
We would be interested in presenting our capabilities in webinars or other events and are open to other ideas.
