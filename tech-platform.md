## Why is Tradle's approach to 100% private data so essential?

Innovation in AI and health is astounding, but could be evolving 10x faster still if a broader group of AI developers had access to data. 
If people were the only true owners of their data, they would entrust a lot more data to be kept and processed by federated AI. 

## Why is Tradle's transactional messaging app so essential? 
Today most of the population is used to WhatsApp or other messenger on mobiles. 
Convenience and wide coverage are there, but for a regulated field this is not enough. Ability to enforce protocols and compliance rules, create auditable records, guaranteed long term storage of data, ability to share structured data, and full Data Governance to assure that AI can make decisions reliably, - all of the above and more are needed in healthcare.

## Collaboration
Tradle is looking to partner with longevity / anti-aging organizations. 
We would be interested in presenting our capabilities in webinars or other events and are open to other ideas.
